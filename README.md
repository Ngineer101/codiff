# Codiff

Codiff is a beautiful, minimal, local diff viewer for reviewing staged and unstaged Git changes before committing.

## Why Codiff

- **Fast Local Reviews:** See changes in any Git repository to review code before committing.
- **LLM Walkthroughs:** Run `codiff -w` to ask Codex to give you a review order and more context.
- **Inline Review Comments:** Comment directly on changed lines and copy all review comments as Markdown for follow-ups.

## Download

Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask nkzw-tech/tap/codiff
```

Download the latest Codiff app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nkzw-tech/codiff/releases).

After installing the app, run `Codiff > Install Terminal Helper` to make the `codiff` command available in your shell.

## Command Line

```bash
codiff
```

Run it from any Git repository, or pass a path:

```bash
codiff /path/to/repository
```

Review a specific commit:

```bash
codiff a1b2c3d
```

Start with an LLM-generated walkthrough order:

```bash
codiff -w
codiff -w a1b2c3d
```

Launching Codiff in multiple repositories opens a separate native window for each repository.

## Codex Walkthroughs

Codiff uses the local Codex CLI for walkthroughs and inline review assistance. Install Codex and
verify it is available before using `codiff -w`:

```bash
codex --version
```

Codiff looks for Codex on `PATH`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, and `/usr/local/bin/codex`. It does not
run your shell startup files to discover Codex. If Codex is installed somewhere else, launch Codiff
with an explicit path:

```bash
CODIFF_CODEX_PATH=/absolute/path/to/codex codiff -w
```

## Development

```bash
vp install
vp build
vpr codiff
```

For live development:

```bash
vpr dev
ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173 vpr electron
```

Useful checks:

```bash
vp check
vp test
vp build
```
